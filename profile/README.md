# Peak&Tower

> An independent AI research studio building high-concept interactive experiences from first-principles technology.

## About Us

**Peak & Tower** is a modern research and development studio, dedicated to exploring the intersection of computational science and narrative art. We are an indie, solo-led studio focused on creating innovative technology to power the next generation of high-concept games and interactive media.

Our work is defined by a commitment to deep, foundational research, believing that the most compelling experiences emerge from a true understanding of the underlying mathematical and philosophical principles.

## Our Philosophy

* ### 🔬 Research-Driven
    We don't just use the latest tech; we build it from the ground up. Our projects are born from rigorous academic research, formal proofs, and a desire to solve the fundamental, unsolved problems in our field.

* ### 📐 Mathematically-Grounded
    We believe that elegance and robustness come from a solid mathematical foundation. From differential geometry to distributed consensus, we use formal methods to build systems that are not only powerful but also coherent and predictable.

* ### ✨ Emergence by Design
    Our goal is to create "possibility spaces"—rich, simulated worlds that allow for true emergence. We design the physics of the system and allow the narrative to unfold, creating experiences that are unique to every user.
